# Statistical Simulation

# Project Summary

This post explains what statistical simulation is and how it is done in R and Python. 

It contains two parts: part 1. sampling; part 2. distribution and applications. 

In part 1, I introduce how to create random numbers, sample with equal and uneuqal probabilities, their applications. In part 2, I apply these distributions to solve real-life Data Science Interview questions. 

The entire write-ups are available here.

Part t: https://towardsdatascience.com/statistical-simulation-in-python-part-2-91f71f474f77

## Installing

To replicate part 1, please install dplyr in R. To replicate part 2, please install numpy in Python.
