# Statistical Simulation in Python

# Project Summary

This repo hosts R/Python code to common statistical distributions. This is an on-going project, and currently it has three parts:
1. sampling (part 1)
2. distribution and applications (part 2)
3. An end-to-end intro to A/B tests
4. Why A/A Tests? What if we fail A/A tests?

In part 1, I introduce how to create random numbers, sample with equal and unequal probabilities, their applications. In part 2, I apply these distributions to solve real-life Data Science Interview questions. Part 3 walks through how to conduct an A/B test end-to-end with simulated data. 

The entire write-ups are available here.
